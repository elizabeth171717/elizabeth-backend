          This project is a website for a Taekwondo gym. It features responsive
          design smooth animations and engaging user experience. The owner
          wanted to make it easy for people to find the gym and contact him, so
          I used a fixed navigation bar that contains phone number, location,
          gym hours,and social media icons along with text slider with the same
          information. Next I used cards to display the classes the gym offers,
          in each card there is a class image, description and CTA . I included
          google analitycs to track site traffic and engagemant. I have been
          working on these project 3 years now.
